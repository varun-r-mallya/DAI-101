## Problem
> This week tutorial problem: Train a logistic regression model on a given diagnostic dataset (dataset from kaggle) and evaluate its performance by calculating the accuracy of the model on a test set.
> 1. Model Evaluation: In addition to accuracy, ask them to find other performance metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or ROC-AUC and plot confusion matrices or ROC curves to see the model performance.
> 2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques such as cross-validation or grid search to optimize the model’s parameters and then check model performance again and see if there is any improvement in model’s accuracy. 
> 3. Ask for analysis of feature importance or coefficients to understand which features are driving the predictions.
